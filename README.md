## Automatic khinsider album downloader made in **Python**
Poorly made automatic Khinsider site music downloader just for personal use, but If you'll like it - that fine I guess.
By now it **supports only MP3** format and uses selenium.
By default it's set up to use **Edge** as default browser that could be easly swapped with other chromium based browsers (I'm not sure if every browser option will work on other [like Firefox for example]).
In the future I'm planning to ditch out selenium completely in the sake of using only requests packet.
